# Python Todo App

## Overview

A simple CRUD todo app built with Django, React, and deployed with Heroku. This app allows users to create, edit, and delete a todo which is all handled on the Django backend and served to the React.js frontend.

### Future Development

Add a Auth system to allow users to create accounts and login so they can make their own personal todos instead of a community todo list.
